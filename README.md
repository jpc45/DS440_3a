# DS440_3a

This repository contains the code and data that Dylan & Josh used for their DS 440 Capstone at PSU
The file 440_Test.ipynb contains the scripts for importing the data, processing the tweets, running BERT, running TF-IDF, and running KFOLD with Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and ADABoost Classifier

The environmental tweets csv is the test data we used
The hope sample csv is the training data we used

The enviromental BERT csv is the prediction sample we created and sent to the client

The tweets_sentiment_capstone.ipynb is the original jupyter notebook file that Dylan coded when we began the project
